Use mid-session when @jwildfire says 'session update: …', 'add that to the session todo', or work surfaces a task to pick up later — the item lands in the session scratchpad that session-wrapup sweeps and session-init re-reads. Do NOT use for already-scoped roadmap work (file/edit the issue directly) or for prose observations (that is session-note)."

# Session Update

Capture a todo the moment it surfaces, so it survives the session without
interrupting the work in flight. Items go to the **session scratchpad** — the
mid-session capture channel between [`session-init`](../session-init/SKILL.md)
(which re-reads unfinished items at the next kickoff) and
[`session-wrapup`](../session-wrapup/SKILL.md) (which sweeps them into durable
homes: an issue, a diary loose end, or memory).

## The session scratchpad

One file per day, in the **workspace root** (not a git repo — nothing to commit):

```
.claude/session-notes/YYYY-MM-DD.md
```

Created on first write with this skeleton:

```markdown
# Session scratchpad — YYYY-MM-DD

## Overview

## Todo

## Notes

## Session log
```

`## Overview` belongs to [`session-init`](../session-init/SKILL.md) (the
persisted kickoff list); `## Todo` belongs to this skill; `## Notes` belongs to
[`session-note`](../session-note/SKILL.md); `## Session log` belongs to the
heartbeat (below). Lines are checked off (`- [x]`) when captured elsewhere —
never deleted.

### The heartbeat: every agent logs key events

The scratchpad is shared by **all of the day's sessions** — lead, siblings, and
ultracode jobs — and [`session-wrapup`](../session-wrapup/SKILL.md) folds it as
the session inventory, so an unlogged event is invisible at wrapup. Three
mechanisms keep it current (the lean-bookends design, 2026-07-14):

- **Spawn briefing** — `scaffold:spawn` (v1.0.2+) instructs every sibling to log
  key events (start, milestones, PRs/issues posted, blockers, completion) and to
  append a final close-out line (what shipped, what's unfinished) before it
  ends.
- **Stop-hook nudge** — a workspace hook
  (`.claude/hooks/scratchpad-heartbeat.sh`) reminds any working session that
  goes >30 minutes without a scratchpad write, once per staleness window.
- **This skill and `session-note`** — @jwildfire's and the lead's own capture
  channels.

**Multi-writer rules:** log under `## Session log` as tagged one-liners —
`- HH:MM {tag} — {event}` with the session's tag (`😺🤖 lead`, `👯🤖 {slug}`,
`⚡️🤖 {description}`) and links inline. **Append-only via shell `>>`** — never
rewrite the file with the Write tool from a sibling; concurrent sessions share
it. The lead may edit other sections (check-offs, Overview refresh) after
re-reading the file. If the file is missing, create it via `>>` with the
skeleton above.

## When to Use

- @jwildfire says "session update: …", "add X to the session todo", "don't let me
  forget…", or similar mid-session.
- Work in flight surfaces a follow-up task that shouldn't derail the current
  thread.

**Do not use** for work that already has (or clearly deserves) an issue — file or
edit the issue directly instead; the scratchpad is for items too small or too raw
to scope yet. For non-task observations, use `session-note`.

## Procedure

1. **Resolve today's scratchpad** — `.claude/session-notes/YYYY-MM-DD.md` under
   the workspace root; create it (and the directory) with the skeleton above if
   missing.
2. **Append the item** under `## Todo`:

   ```markdown
   - [ ] {item} *(added HH:MM)*
   ```

   Keep the item one line and self-contained — it will be read cold at wrapup or
   next kickoff; include links/issue numbers if they exist.
3. **Confirm** by echoing the current Todo list back, so @jwildfire sees the
   running state. Then return to the interrupted work — adding the item is not a
   license to start it.

## Lifecycle

- [`session-todo`](../session-todo/SKILL.md) re-renders the full session list
  (kickoff priorities + these additions + notes) on demand and checks items off
  as they finish.
- `session-wrapup` sweeps unchecked items into durable homes and checks them off.
- `session-init` carries any still-unchecked items (e.g. from a session that
  ended without a wrapup) into the next kickoff list.
